                 <h4>About</h4>

                 <p>"AndroidBottomSheet" is an Android-library, which provides a bottom sheet as proposed by Android's Material design guidelines (see <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html">here</a> for further details), which even works on pre-Lollipop devices. A bottom sheet is supposed to contain menu items, which can be clicked by the user. By default only a few items are shown, but by dragging the bottom sheet, it can be expanded to display all items. The following screenshot shows the appearance of a bottom sheet, which has been created by using the library:</p>

                 <p><center><a href="images/example.png" target="_blank".><img src="images/example.png" alt="Example"></a></center></p>

                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The library provides a builder, which allows to create bottom sheets by specifying a title, icon, items etc.</li>
                    <li>A bottom sheet's items can be displayed as a list, as a two-columned list or as a grid.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to separate a bottom sheet's items by adding dividers (with optional titles).</li>
                    <li>The library offers a possibility to display all applications, which are suited for handling an <tt>Intent</tt>, as a bottom sheet's items</li>
                    <li>The items of a bottom sheet can be enabled/disabled individually.</li>
                    <li>As an alternative to displaying items, a bottom sheet's items can be be replaced with a custom view.</li>
                    <li>The library comes with a dark theme in addition to the default light theme. Both themes can be modified by using theme attributes.</li>
                </ul>
