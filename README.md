# AndroidBottomSheet - README

"AndroidBottomSheet" is an Android-library, which provides a bottom sheet as a proposed by Android's Material design guidelines (see [here](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-sheets.html) for further details), which even works on pre-Lollipop devices. A bottom sheet is supposed to contain menu items, which can be clicked by the user. By default only a few items are shown, but by dragging the bottom sheet, it can be expanded to display all items. The following screenshot shows the appearance of a bottom sheet, which has been created by using the library:

The library provides the following features:

- The library provides a builder, which allows to create bottom sheets by specifying a title, icon, items etc.
- A bottom sheet's items can be displayed as a list, as a two-columned list or as a grid.
- It is possible to separate a bottom sheet's items by adding dividers (with optional titles).
- The library offers a possibility to display all applications, which are suited for handling an Intent, as a bottom sheet's items
- The items of a bottom sheet can be enabled/disabled individually.
- As an alternative to displaying items, a bottom sheet's items can be be replaced with a custom view.
- The library comes with a dark theme in addition to the default light theme. Both themes can be modified by using theme attributes.

## Download

The latest release of this library can be downloaded as a zip archive from the download section of the project's Github page, which is available [here](https://github.com/michael-rapp/AndroidBottomSheet/releases). Furthermore, the library's source code is available as a Git repository, which can be cloned using the URL https://github.com/michael-rapp/AndroidBottomSheet.git.

Alternatively, the library can be added to your Android app as a Gradle dependency by adding the following to the respective module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.michael-rapp:android-bottom-sheet:1.4.0'
}
```

## Examples

The code below shows how to create and show a bottom sheet by using the library's `BottomSheet.Builder`. The bottom sheet contains a title as well as multiple items and dividers. The `this` parameter, which is passed to the builder's constructor in the example below, must be a `Context`, e.g. an `Activity`. By calling the builder's `setOnItemClickListener`-method, a listener can be registered to be notified, when one of the bottom sheet's items has been clicked.

```java
BottomSheet.Builder builder = new BottomSheet.Builder(this); 
builder.setTitle(R.string.bottom_sheet_title);
builder.addItem(R.string.item1_title, R.drawable.item1_icon);
builder.addItem(R.string.item2_title, R.drawable.item2_icon);
builder.addDivider();
builder.addItem(R.string.item3_title, R.drawable.item3_icon);
builder.addItem(R.string.item4_title, R.drawable.item4_icon);
builder.addDivider(R.string.divider_title);
builder.addItem(R.string.item5_title, R.drawable.item5_icon);
builder.addItem(R.string.item6_title, R.drawable.item6_icon);
BottomSheet bottomSheet = builder.create();
bottomSheet.show();
```

### Displaying suitable applications for handling an intent

Instead of manually specifying the items of a bottom sheet, it is also possible to display the applications, which are suited for handling a specific `Intent`. This is possible by using the `setIntent`-method as shown in the example code below. The `this` parameter, which is passed to the `setIntent`-method has to be an `Activity`. 

```java
BottomSheet.Builder builder = new BottomSheet.Builder(this);
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "This is my text to send.");
intent.setType("text/plain");
builder.setIntent(this, intent);
```

The image below illustrates the appearance of bottom sheets, which show applications that are suited for handling the `Intent` used in the previous example.

### Using the dark theme

By default the bottom sheet uses a light theme, which can be referenced by using the resource id `R.style.BottomSheet_Light`. If a dark theme should be used instead, the resource id `R.style.BottomSheet` has to be passed to the builder's constructor like shown below. 

```java
BottomSheet.Builder builder = new BottomSheet.Builder(this, R.style.BottomSheet);
```

Alternatively, the default theme, which is used by all bottom sheets by default, can be changed globally by using the theme attribute `bottomSheetTheme`. The attribute has to be included in the app's theme, which is defined in the `res/values/styles.xml` file, like it is shown below:

```xml
<resources>

    <style name="AppTheme" parent="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">
        <item name="colorPrimary">@color/color_primary</item>
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/color_primary_dark</item>
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/color_accent</item>
        <item name="bottomSheetTheme">@style/BottomSheet</item>
    </style>

</resources>
```

The following screenshot shows the appearance of a bottom sheet using the dark theme.
